> ### This is a beta release
> Consider using the [stable version](https://github.com/zevnda/steam-game-idler/releases/latest) unless you specifically want to test new features.
> The `.msi` installer is not fully compressed, hence the large file size. This is expected for a beta release.
> This release will not receive automatic updates. If a newer beta version becomes available you will need to install it manually.
