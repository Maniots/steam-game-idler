## Changelog
- Added an `anti-away status` option to `settings > general`
  - Prevents your Steam status from automatically switching to `away` while SGI is running
- SGI by default will now be minimized to the system tray when clicking the `close` button on the `title bar`
  - This allows users to hide SGI while it continues to work in the background
  - Exit SGI completely by right-clicking the icon in the system tray and clicking exit
  - You can disable this feature by unchecking `minimize to tray` in `settings > general`
