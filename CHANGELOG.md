## Changelog
- #71: Added a check to see if a game has server-side achievements and display an alert on the `achievements manager` screen if it does
  - Even if only 1/50 achievements are server-side, this message will still appear but other achievements can still be modified
  - References this list on games https://gist.github.com/zevnda/c7ebc4de0fb3e9ff6caac4df0a3fd06c
    - Feel free to leave a comment on the gist if any games need to be added/removed
