## Changelog
- Replaced the msi installer (.msi) with the nsis installer (.exe)
  - Smaller portable installer file
  - Faster initial installation and automatic updates
  - Supports patch updates by downloading only changed files instead of the full installer for each update, saving on bandwidth

Note: The transition between installers should be seamless, but is some cases users might end up with two separate installations of SGI. If this is the case, just uninstall the older version
