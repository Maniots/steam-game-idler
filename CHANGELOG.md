## Changelog
- Added `idling games` to the `sidebar` *(beta)*
  - This will hopefully replace the need for showing external SteamUtility *(idle)* windows for every game you idle
  - When a game begins idling it will be shown in the `idling games` list
  - You can stop idling individual games by hovering over their `game card` and clicking the stop icon
  - You can stop idling all games by clicking the `stop all` button
  - While this feature is in beta you will continue to see the external idle windows *(unless you use the `hide idle windows` setting)* just in case there are any problems
  - If you do have any problems, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/zevnda/steam-game-idler/issues/new?template=issue_report.yml)
- #60: Added a pulsing border around `game cards` of currently idling games
- #134: Fix `achievement unlocker` getting stuck at 1 second
